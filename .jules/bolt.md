## 2024-05-23 - [Hot Path Map Allocations]
**Learning:** Found that `checkKillAchievements` and `checkHeadshotAchievements` in the worker pool were re-allocating `map[int64]string` on every single event. In a high-throughput event ingestion system, this created significant GC pressure and CPU overhead (~90ns/op vs ~5ns/op).
**Action:** Always inspect hot loops/worker handlers for hidden allocations like map literals or slice creations. Move immutable lookup tables to package-level variables.
